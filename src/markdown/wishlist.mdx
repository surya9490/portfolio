## ðŸ›  Features

This app includes a robust admin panel and an intuitive storefront integration that work seamlessly together to enhance the customer experience.

The Admin Panel allows merchants to customize their wishlist experience with features like variant detection, guest wishlist support, and toaster notifications for feedback when products are added or removed from the wishlist. The Dashboard provides valuable insights into wishlist data, such as the total number of wishlisted items, unique products, page views, customer stats, and the top-wishlisted products.

On the storefront side, the app integrates a visually appealing wishlist pop-up that allows users to easily add items to their wishlist. It also includes search functionality for users to quickly find their wishlisted products, while the interactive wishlist icon dynamically updates based on the state of the wishlist.
